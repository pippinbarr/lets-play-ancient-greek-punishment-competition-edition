## Description
*Fly like an eagle! Climb every mountain! Reach for the stars! I mean apple! Empty your opponent's bathtub just before they get in!*

_Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment: Competition Edition_ is a new edition in the _Let's Play: Ancient Greek Punishment_ series, focusing on a retelling of five (kind of) mythological punishments. In the _Competition Edition_ the dream of a two-player experience of eternal punishment is finally at hand. Face off against your friends in the classic battle between punisher and punished.

The game was written in JavaScript using the excellent [Phaser](https://phaser.io) game framework.
